THE APARTMENT
The building only has 7 apartments in total. Your new neighbours are lovely. They all enjoy spending time at the beach and they are mature enough to avoid late nights and loud parties so you won't be disturbed.

THE BALCONY
It wraps around the front of the building and gives you a huge entertaining space. From the balcony you stare straight at the water and out to the horizon. It's stunning!

INTERNALLY
We have furnished the apartment using light and bright colours to capture all of the sun that pours into the rooms throughout the day. There are three different eating areas - the dining table, the breakfast bar with views out to the beach and an outdoor table and chairs (where you'll probably spend most of your time)

ENTERTAINMENT
If you want to, you can sit inside and watch the huge 54" TV and use the DVD player or you can walk to Bondi and watch some real life entertainment at any one of the bars, clubs or live band venues.

ACCOMMODATION
There are 3 bedrooms at The BEACHFRONT Apartment. they all have queen size beds. The Apartment can accommodate a total of 6 people in complete comfort. Two bedrooms share a bathroom and the main bedroom has its own ensuite and direct access to the balcony. The shared bathroom has its own deep bathtub plus a separate shower.

There is plenty of crockery, cutlery and glassware for you and all of your guests and enough chairs for them too!

Guest access

All guests will have free access to all the amenities and facilities in the Apartment. This includes a coffee machine, dishwasher, washing machine, dryer, 434 litre fridge, a complete library of books, 54" TV & DVD Player, wireless broadband internet, sound system and an intercom / security system.

TRANSPORT
Once you arrive at The BEACHFRONT Apartment you probably won't want to leave. But should the need arise, there is transport immediately out the front. The #361 bus stop is across the ride and it will take you to Bondi Junction or Bondi Beach. From the Junction you can catch buses and trains to the city. The bus is handy, however, most things are within walking distance anyway.

Interaction with guests

Unfortunately, we don't get to meet the guests. We leave keys outside in a 'lockbox' which allows you to collect them whenever you arrive. We usually stay nearby and are available in the event that you need help with anything.

Other things to note

FREE BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE
We want you to have a great time when you stay at our place. We like the idea of you sitting out on the balcony celebrating something and admiring the view. So, anyone that books for 3 nights or more will find a bottle of Veuve Cliquot in the fridge upon arrival.

SAVING LIVES
We are really thankful to live by the beach and it's a stunning beach. One of the things that makes this beach a great place to swim and have fun in summer are the lifesavers who volunteer their time to look after the people who use the beach. Chances are that you've chosen our place partly because of the beach out the front. So to thank the guys that look after the beach for us, 10% of everything that you pay to us will be given to them as a donation. It's the least we can do for the guys that keep the beach safe.

We'll send you a copy of the receipt and any comments that we get from them in thanks.`,
